# Calculator
The program takes a string as the first command line argument and returns a solved equation.  
There are brackets to set priorities and five operations with numbers.  
Each operation must be separated from numbers by one space.  
Each bracket must be closed correctly.  

## Example of operations

### Plus:

2 + 2 -> 4

### Minus:

2 - 2   ->  0   
5 - 25  ->  -20

### Multiplication:

2 * 2   ->  4  
2 * -2  ->  -4

### Division:

2 / 2   ->  1  
4 / 20  ->  0

### Modulo:

2 % 2   ->  0  
42 % 20 ->  2

## Example of right equation

(2 * 42) - 30 + (20 - 80) / 30  ->  52  
(89 % 3) * 35 + (10 * (70 / 5)) ->  210
