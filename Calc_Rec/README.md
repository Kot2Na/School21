# Calculator
Program takes string as first command line argument and returns solved equation.  
There are brackets to set priorities and five operations with numbers.  
Each operation must be separated by one space from numbers.  
Each bracket must be correctly closed.  

## Example of operations

### Plus:

2 + 2 -> 4

### Minus:

2 - 2   ->  0   
5 - 25  ->  -20

### Multiplication:

2 * 2   ->  4  
2 * -2  ->  -4

### Division:

2 / 2   ->  1  
4 / 20  ->  0

### Modulo:

2 % 2   ->  0  
42 % 20 ->  2

## Example of right equation

(2 * 42) - 30 + (20 - 80) / 30  ->  52  
(89 % 3) * 35 + (10 * (70 / 5)) ->  210
